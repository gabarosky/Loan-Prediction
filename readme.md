# Loan Pre-Approval Predictor  
**Machine Learning · Python · Streamlit**

This project is a small end-to-end Machine Learning application that predicts the **pre-approval status of a loan application** based on applicant information.  
It includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and an interactive web interface built with **Streamlit**.

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer**  
> The predictions generated by this application are **non-binding and for informational purposes only**.  
> They do **not** constitute a financial offer or an official credit decision.

## 📊 Dataset Source

The dataset used in this project comes from the following public machine learning competition:

**Loan Prediction Practice Problem (III)**  
Organized by **Analytics Vidhya**

🔗 https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/datahack/contest/practice-problem-loan-prediction-iii/

The data is used **strictly for educational and demonstration purposes**.  
All rights and credits belong to Analytics Vidhya and the original data providers.

## 📓 Notebooks

The `notebook/` directory contains **experimental and exploratory Jupyter notebooks**, used for:

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering experimentation
- Model comparison and hyperparameter tuning
- Validation of preprocessing and modeling decisions

⚠️ These notebooks are **not part of the production pipeline** and should be considered exploratory only.  
The **authoritative training and inference logic** is implemented in the `scripts/` and `app/` directories.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Pipeline

The model training pipeline consists of the following steps:

1. **Feature Engineering**
   - Total Income
   - Estimated Loan Installment
   - Income Impact Ratio

2. **Preprocessing**
   - Numerical features: `StandardScaler` + `PCA`
   - Categorical features: `SimpleImputer` + `OneHotEncoder`

3. **Model**
   - `CatBoostClassifier`

All steps are wrapped in a single `scikit-learn Pipeline` to ensure consistency between training and inference.

## 🛠️ Installation

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-folder>
````

### 2. Create a virtual environment (recommended)

```bash
python -m venv .venv
```

Activate it:

* **Windows**

```bash
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

* **Linux / macOS**

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 🏋️ Train the Model

Ensure `train.csv` is present in the `data/` directory.

```bash
python scripts/train_model.py
```

This process will:

* Clean the raw dataset
* Train the complete ML pipeline
* Save the trained model to `models/trained_model.pkl`

---

## 🖥️ Run the Streamlit App

```bash
streamlit run app/main.py
```

Open your browser at:

```
http://localhost:8501
```

---

## 🔁 Reproducibility Notes

* All preprocessing and feature engineering steps are included in the pipeline
* The same pipeline object is used for training and prediction
* Project paths are centralized in `config.py`
* Model artifacts are explicitly versioned in `models/`
